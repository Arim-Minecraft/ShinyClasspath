# ShinyClasspath
A simple package of shaded dependencies.

## Usage

It is intended that dependent projects *reshade and relocate* ShinyClasspath dependencies.

The exception to this rule is [ArimAPI](https://github.com/Arim-Minecraft/ArimAPI), for which this project was created. Thus, dependents of ArimAPI need simply add it as a dependency with no requirement for using ShinyClasspath in any way.
